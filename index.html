        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Nick Tan, a first-year student at the University of Riverside, where Iâ€™m majoring in Music. Balancing a rigorous academic schedule with a part-time job, I teach violin to children, a role that mirrors my dedication to my field and my belief in the power of music education to transform lives. Music has been a fundamental part of my life since I was a child. Raised in a musically inclined family, my earliest memories are filled with sounds of melodies and rhythms. I started playing the violin at five, a gift from my grandmother, who was a retired orchestra violinist. Her guidance and tales of her musical adventures ignited my passion for music and shaped my career aspirations.<br><br>

        Throughout my youth, my relationship with music deepened. I participated in and won several youth music competitions, played in youth orchestras, and earned numerous awards for my solo performances. In high school, I was a key member of the symphony orchestra and began volunteering at community centers to introduce children to music, which was profoundly rewarding. Choosing to attend the University of Riverside was a strategic decision driven by its renowned music program and its close proximity to diverse communities, allowing me to engage in meaningful outreach. My academic achievements here have been notable, including maintaining a place on the Deanâ€™s List and receiving a scholarship in recognition of my potential as a future music educator. My part-time job as a violin instructor at a local music school for children is where I bring my skills and passions to life. I teach violin to a group of young, enthusiastic learners, employing a personalized teaching approach that blends traditional methods with innovative, interactive learning strategies to make the process enjoyable and engaging. I believe that learning an instrument can greatly benefit a child's cognitive development, creativity, and self-esteem.Â <br><br>

       Beyond teaching violin techniques, I endeavor to instill a love and appreciation for music in my students, encouraging them to explore different musical genres and participate in community music events. Many of my students have performed at local recitals and school concerts, returning with exciting stories about their musical journeys. Additionally, I have initiated a community outreach program called "Strings for Kids," which offers free violin workshops and concerts to children in underprivileged areas. This initiative not only gives these children a chance to engage with music but also enriches the cultural life of our community. Looking ahead, I plan to complete my degree at the University of Riverside and pursue a masterâ€™s degree in Music Education. My ultimate ambition is to open my own music school to broaden my impact on young musicians. Through my academic achievements and dedication to service, I am committed to proving that with passion and perseverance, one can make a profound impact through music.
